# Assignment: Cyber Mad Libs â€“ Java Variables & Scanner

## Objective
In this assignment, you will practice **declaring variables** and **collecting user input** using the `Scanner` class.  
You will fill in the blanks of a pre-written story with your own values to create a fun, cybersecurity-themed Mad Libs.

---

## Instructions

### 1. Open the Provided Java File
Download and open `CyberMadLibs.java` from GitHub Classroom in VS Code.

### 2. Declare the Variables
At the top of the `main` method, declare the following variables exactly as shown (names must match):

String adjective;
String verb;
String nounServer;
String pluralNoun;
String techTerm;
String exclamationPhrase;

### 3. Prompt for Input
Use Scanner to ask the user for each value.

Example:
System.out.print("Enter an adjective (e.g., glitchy): ");

adjective = in.nextLine();

Repeat for verb, nounServer, pluralNoun, techTerm, and exclamationPhrase.

### 4. Story Output
The story is already written for you and uses the variables you just created.  
Do not change the story textâ€”your job is to make sure the program compiles and outputs a complete sentence.

When run, it should look like this:

Enter an adjective (e.g., glitchy): glitchy  
Enter a verb: hack  
Enter a type of server: server  
Enter a plural noun: pixels  
Enter a tech term: firewall  
Enter an exclamation phrase: Quick! Deploy the backup spaghetti code!  

Your story:  
It was a glitchy day in the Code Dojo. I was about to hack my server when suddenly the pixels crashed into the firewall. My instructor yelled, "Quick! Deploy the backup spaghetti code!"
